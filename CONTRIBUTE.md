## Contributing

### Reporting bugs and feature requests

You can report bugs and request features on [freeCodeCamp.org's main repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues).

### Developing and making pull requests

The [build](/build) directory gets deployed and is made available at the root of the top-level domain.

Examples:

- `/build/ => https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/`

- `/build/asset/camperbot.jpg => https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/asset/camperbot.jpg`

Your pull-request should be made to the build directory and should already have pre-compiled, compressed and minified assets as needed.
